This Repository holds the pcap used for generating the dataset used in my paper: 

[Igbe, O.; Darwish, I.; and Saadawi, T., “Deterministic Dendritic Cell Algorithm Application to Smart-Grid Cyber Attack Detection,” presented at the proceedings of the 4th IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and CloudComputing, June 2017.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316701640_Deterministic_Dendritic_Cell_Algorithm_Application_to_Smart_Grid_Cyber-Attack_Detection)

It also contains the extracted dataset n .csv format and Snort IDS rules that can be used to detect the attacks
